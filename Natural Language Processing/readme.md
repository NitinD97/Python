# Natural Language Processing
Here I will be adding all the code that I work on that concerns NLP. Most probably I'll work on the following libraries: 
> Spacy \
> nltk

## Running the code
To run the code related to spacy, follow these steps:

-  Install Spacy \
``python3 -m pip install spacy``

-  Install nltk \
``python3 -m pip install nltk``

-  Download data for the library. This command is for small model (~12 mb) in english: \
``python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm``

- To download medium model(~50 mb), use: \
``python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_md``

- To download large model(~790 mb), use: \
``python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_lg`` 

### Find something wrong:
If you find something wrong regarding the code/implementation. Feel free to contact me or Raise a PR.
