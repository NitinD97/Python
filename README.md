# Python
Codes made in python. \
Just a simple python repository, for adding and collecting different types of python codes.
Codes in this repository are for reference and usage if required. These can also be used to clarify general concepts 
in python. 

## Running the scripts:
The scripts are written in `python3.6`. 
Install python on your devices. 

You may use `venv` for running the programs.
> python3 -m pip install --upgrade virtualenv

To install the dependencies in `venv`:
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Run the program using the following command:
> python3 script_name.py
